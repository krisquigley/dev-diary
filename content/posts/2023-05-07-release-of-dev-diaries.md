Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Dev Blog! I am thrilled to announce that we have not only brought back the blog, but we have also managed to restore all the old posts, ensuring that the knowledge and insights shared over the years remain accessible to all.

In this new chapter for the Dev Blog, we will be focusing on documenting the various projects that I am currently working on. These projects span a wide range of topics and technologies, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to web development and even a bit of hardware tinkering. So, without further ado, let's dive in and take a look at some of the exciting projects that are in the works!

Py Mouse: A Furry, Robotic Companion for Your Cat
The first project on the list is "Py Mouse," which aims to train a mouse-like robot through reinforcement learning, enabling it to behave like a real mouse. Once the training is complete, the robot will be embedded into an Arduino device, creating a fun and engaging toy for my cat to play with. This project is an exciting blend of machine learning, robotics, and hardware development, and I can't wait to see the final product.

Hazel: Automating the Digital Life
Next up is "Hazel," an AI assistant designed to automate as much of my digital life as possible. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Hazel will help manage tasks such as email organization, appointment scheduling, and social media management, among others. The goal of this project is to free up more time for more important tasks and foster a more balanced and productive digital lifestyle.

Digital Buddha: A Chatbot with Spiritual Wisdom
Have you ever wanted to ask the Buddha a question? With "Digital Buddha," that just might be possible. This chatbot project aims to answer questions on Buddhism as if the Buddha himself were providing the insights. By utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, Digital Buddha will be able to engage users in meaningful conversations about life, spirituality, and the principles of Buddhism.

Ratanagiri Rebuild: A Fresh Take on the Aruna Ratanagiri Site
Last but not least, we have the "Ratanagiri Rebuild" project. This initiative seeks to revamp the Aruna Ratanagiri website, modernizing its design and improving its overall user experience. With a focus on responsive design, accessibility, and a clean aesthetic, the new site will serve as a welcoming digital home for the Aruna Ratanagiri community.

As we embark on this exciting journey together, I look forward to sharing my experiences and insights with all of you through the revitalized Dev Blog. Stay tuned for regular updates on these projects and, as always, feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions you may have.

Until next time, happy coding!
